# Security Policy

## Overview

TrustLens takes security seriously. This document outlines our security practices, policies, and how to report security vulnerabilities.

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.x.x   | :white_check_mark: |

## Security Architecture

### Authentication & Authorization
- **JWT tokens**: Short-lived access tokens with refresh mechanism
- **API keys**: Per-organization rate-limited keys for API access
- **Role-based access**: User/Admin/Owner roles with appropriate permissions
- **SSO integration**: SAML/OIDC for enterprise customers

### Data Protection
- **Encryption at rest**: AES-256 for sensitive data storage
- **Encryption in transit**: TLS 1.3 for all API communications
- **PII scrubbing**: Automatic removal of personally identifiable information
- **Data retention**: Configurable retention periods, automatic purging

### Infrastructure Security
- **Container security**: Regular vulnerability scanning of Docker images
- **Network isolation**: VPC with private subnets for sensitive services
- **Secrets management**: HashiCorp Vault or cloud provider secret stores
- **Access logging**: Comprehensive audit trails for all system access

## Privacy Protections

### Content Processing
- **Transient analysis**: Text content processed temporarily, not stored permanently
- **URL hashing**: Only store cryptographic hashes of analyzed URLs
- **Image handling**: Process images without storing raw pixel data
- **Metadata only**: Retain only non-identifying metadata for analytics

### GDPR/CCPA Compliance
- **Data minimization**: Collect only necessary data for service operation
- **User rights**: Support for access, rectification, erasure, and portability
- **Consent management**: Clear opt-in/opt-out mechanisms
- **Data residency**: EU data processing options for European users

### Content Restrictions
- **No individual profiling**: Analysis limited to content, not user behavior
- **Public content only**: Process only publicly available or user-owned content
- **Respect robots.txt**: Honor website crawling restrictions
- **ToS compliance**: Adhere to platform terms of service

## Abuse Prevention

### Rate Limiting
- **API endpoints**: Tiered rate limits based on subscription level
- **Browser extension**: Client-side throttling to prevent spam
- **IP-based limits**: Additional protection against automated abuse
- **Usage monitoring**: Automated detection of unusual usage patterns

### Content Safeguards
- **No harassment profiling**: Refuse to analyze content for targeted harassment
- **Political neutrality**: Maintain balanced approach across political spectra
- **Misinformation focus**: Target systematic manipulation, not political opinions
- **Human oversight**: Manual review of edge cases and appeals

## Vulnerability Disclosure

### Reporting Security Issues

We appreciate security researchers and users who report vulnerabilities to us. To report a security issue:

**Email**: security@trustlens.ai

**Please include**:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact assessment
- Your contact information

**Please do NOT**:
- Disclose the vulnerability publicly before we've addressed it
- Access or modify user data beyond what's necessary to demonstrate the issue
- Perform DoS attacks or spam our services

### Response Process

1. **Acknowledgment**: We'll acknowledge receipt within 24 hours
2. **Assessment**: Initial assessment within 72 hours
3. **Updates**: Regular updates every 5-7 days until resolution
4. **Resolution**: Typical fix timeline of 30-90 days depending on severity
5. **Disclosure**: Coordinated public disclosure after fix deployment

### Security Bug Bounty

We currently operate a private bug bounty program. Eligible security researchers may be rewarded based on:

- **Critical vulnerabilities**: €500-2000
- **High severity**: €200-500
- **Medium severity**: €50-200
- **Low severity**: Recognition in security advisories

## Security Measures by Component

### API Service
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention (parameterized queries)
- XSS protection with Content Security Policy
- CORS configuration for web app integration
- Request size limits and timeout handling

### Web Application
- Content Security Policy (CSP) implementation
- Secure cookie configuration (httpOnly, secure, sameSite)
- CSRF protection with double-submit cookies
- Client-side input validation and encoding
- Dependency vulnerability scanning

### Browser Extension
- Manifest V3 compliance for enhanced security
- Minimal permissions request (activeTab only)
- Content script sandboxing
- Secure communication with API endpoints
- Regular security reviews of extension updates

### ML Models
- Model integrity verification with checksums
- Protection against adversarial inputs
- Differential privacy for training data
- Model explanation to detect bias/manipulation
- Regular retraining to prevent drift attacks

### Infrastructure
- Regular security patching of all systems
- Intrusion detection and prevention systems
- Log monitoring and anomaly detection
- Backup encryption and secure storage
- Disaster recovery and business continuity plans

## Compliance & Certifications

### Current Compliance
- **GDPR**: European data protection regulation
- **CCPA**: California Consumer Privacy Act
- **SOC 2 Type I**: Security, availability, and confidentiality (in progress)

### Planned Certifications
- **SOC 2 Type II**: Operational effectiveness over time
- **ISO 27001**: Information security management systems
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**: Comprehensive security controls
